## About this project

The aim of this project was to mimic the discovery of the Higgs boson, through basic use of linear regression tools.
## To run our model
Six ML methods are accessible through the run.py file. The best method's (Least Square) prediction is outputted to a .csv file when the run.py is ran.
For the model to run:
1. The dataset files test.csv and train.csv need to be in .../data folder present in the same directory. If they are not there, please pull them from the Git directory  
2. Your computer should have a working version of python with numpy installed in the working environement.


Output: After running the run.py, the program would output its prediction for the test dataset in the same folder in a file named final_submission.csv
